ndarray - multidimensional array providing fast array-oriented arithmetic operations and flexible broadcasting capabilities 

Note: NumPy by itself does not provide modeling or scientific functionality. 

NumPy is important for numerical computationsin Python because it is designed for efficiency on large arrays of data. 
    - Numpy iinternally stores data in a contiguous block of memory, independent of other built-in python objects. 
    - NumPy's library of algorithms written in C can operate on this memory without any type-checking or other overhead. 
    - NumPy operations perform complex computations on entire arrays without the need for Python for loops
